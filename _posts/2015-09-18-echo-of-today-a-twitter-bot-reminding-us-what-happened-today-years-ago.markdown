Twitter bots are everywhere. An article from [Quartz](https://qz.com/248063/twitter-admits-that-as-many-as-23-million-of-its-active-users-are-actually-bots/) dated last year states that _up to approximately 8.5% of the accounts considered active are automatically updated_. That means 23 million of Twitterâ€™s 271 million monthly active users are bots. 
Yes, bots on Twitter are extremely popular so I decided to make one myself. I called it [Echo Of Today](https://twitter.com/EchoOfToday). 
Let's see how I did it and what was the result!
